# Song Popularity Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict the popularity of songs using various machine learning models. By leveraging a rich dataset from Kaggle and additional live data from Spotify, our models analyze multiple musical features to forecast the popularity trends of songs. The primary focus is to assist streaming services in enhancing their recommendation systems, thus improving user experience and supporting emerging artists.

## Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Ada Boost
- XG Boost
- Perceptron Algorithms
- Ensemble Methods

## Data
The project utilizes a dataset available on Kaggle provided by a leading digital music service, which includes features such as danceability, energy, key, loudness, and historical popularity scores. Additional live data was fetched from the Spotify API.

## Key Features
- Predictive modeling of song popularity
- Analysis of historical data trends
- Implementation of machine learning algorithms
- Comparative model analysis with Ensemble methods
